As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

This app collects the user's precise location, which is required for the app to function. It also detects nearby iBeacons, again required for the functionality of the app.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email at [bemain.dev@gmail.com](mailto:bemain.dev@gmail.com).

Yours sincerly, \
